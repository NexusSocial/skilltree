# The Skilltree

A collection of experiments and demos for building social VR with bevy and wgpu. 

## Repo Structure

Social VR requires many things - on top of all the regular 3D game programming,
it has additional requirements unique to social VR. Rome wasn't built in a day,
and neither can a Social VR game.

The repository consistes of "skills" which represent a single isolated example
for achieving a specifc technical goal - like doing IK, or loading a VRM. These
aree located in the `skills` folder. These try to do exactly 1 thing.

There are also `demos`, which integrate multiple of these skills into a larger
unified tech demo.

Eventually when the skilltree is fleshed out enough, we will create a new
monorepo specifically for building a full fledged game.
