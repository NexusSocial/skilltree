# Contributors Guide

Thanks for helping out with Nexus!

## Coding guidelines

* Code should compile on all of mac, windows, linux (we will eventually check that in
  CI).
* We enforce `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` in CI.
* Files should end in newlines.
* Try to keep examples as minimal as possible.
* Be sure to use [our discord](https://discord.gg/VQxSKJUa9F) to keep in touch :)
* Dependencies of your code should not use viral licenses like GPL or LGPL (MPL is
  fine) or unlicensed code - if you're not sure, feel free to ask us if the license is
  ok.
